# Taxi Arab Showcase üöñüåç

Welcome to the **Taxi Arab Showcase** repository! This project highlights my backend contributions to a live ride-hailing app, similar to Uber. The application connects real drivers with real customers, providing real-time ride matching. It utilizes technologies such as Laravel, Redis, and Pusher to deliver a seamless experience.
